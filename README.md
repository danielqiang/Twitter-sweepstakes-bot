# twitter-sweepstakes-bot
Twitter-sweepstakes-bot is a script that automatically enters sweepstakes contests on Twitter. It searches twitter for posts containing the phrase "chance to win", and retweets/follows/comments on the post depending on what the post specifies.

# Usage
This bot uses [Tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/v3.5.0/), which is a Twitter API that requires a consumer key pair and access token pair. You can find information on how to get these credentials [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens.html).

Once you have an API key and CSE ID, just put them into twitter_sweepstakes_bot.py and run the script.

# Extras
This was a very quick project, inspired by a [cool DEFCON video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAOOdYsK7MM).
